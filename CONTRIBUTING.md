# Subprojects

Each subdirectory of the root of the hasmer repository represents a different distinct component.

The `hasmer` directory contains the .NET 5 C# project for the actual code of the application. There is autogenerated documentation for the code on the [hasmer website](https://lucasbaizer2.github.io/hasmer/docs/annotated.html).

The `hasm-vscode` directory contains the source for the Visual Studio Code extension for working with Hasm assembly.

The `bytecode-format-generator` directory contains a Node.js script, used for scraping the Hermes git repository for modifications to Hermes bytecode, and parsing the changes made.
This is used for generating definition files for prior versions, as well as new ones.

See each subproject's README for more detailed information on how to build/run/test/etc it:
